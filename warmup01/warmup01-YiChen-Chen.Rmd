### **1. Ingredients** - 4 servings
* 4 lemons  
* 4 cups water  
* sugar, to taste  
* handful of fresh mint leaves  

### **2. Special Kitchen Tools**  
* a grapefruit knife
* a food processor (a blender)
* a fine-mesh strainer
  
### **3. Steps**
i) Clean and wash the lemons. Cut off the top quarter of the lemons and slice a thin bevel off the bottom, so they can stand up straight. (You can skip this step if you don¡¦t want to serve them in frozen lemon cups.) Using a grapefruit knife, carefully remove all of the lemon flesh and juice (working over a bowl ensures you won¡¦t lose any), being careful not to cut through the bottom. Stand the lemons on a plate or cookie sheet and freeze until solid.  
ii) Using a food processor (a blender will work as well), toss a handful of washed and dried fresh mint leaves into the work bowl. (I used about 25 to 30 leaves from 6 to 9 sprigs.) Add the scooped out lemon flesh and juice, and pulse until mostly pureed. Let mixture stand for 15 minutes, so the mint releases its flavor, then press the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. You¡¦ll end up with approximately one cup of lemon-mint juice.  
iii) Stir in the water, then sugar, one tablespoon at a time until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is to your desire level of sweetness. Pour the mixture into a large roasting pan or baking dish, large enough that the liquid isn¡¦t more than one-inch deep. (Otherwise it takes forever to freeze, trust me. A 9¡Ñ13-inch pan worked great here.)
iv) Freeze for one hour, then remove the mixture and scrape with two forks to break up the ice. (Your freezing time will vary, depending on the temperature and muscle of your freezer.) Return to the freezer and freeze until solid, about 2 to 3 hours, scraping it again with forks every hour or so.
v) When the granita is frozen, rake until glittery. Scoop into frozen lemon shells (or, you know, plain old dishes) and serve before Deb gets to it.  

### Is there a special season of the year for it?
Summer!

### Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?
There is a similar recipe, [Lemon Granita](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/lemon-granita-recipe0-1942810). <br/>The ingredients are mainly the same, except using sprigs thyme in this recipe instead of mint leaves.

# **Euclidean Distance**  
### Definition  
***  
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = $(p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and **q** = $(q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):  

$\begin{align}
\tag{1}
d(\textbf{p, q}) = d(\textbf{q, p}) 
& = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \dots + (q_n-p_n)^2}\\
& = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i-p_i)^2}.
\end{align}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **[Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm)**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
\|\textbf{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p.p}},
$$  
\
where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
